## Simulation: Attack rate vs baseline transmission probability
`
python3 dynamic_transmission.py
`

## Simulation: Time-series dynamics
`
python3 fixed_p_dynamic.py p
`

where the parameter  `0 <= p <= 1` is _the disease baseline transmission probability_.


After running the program, the results will be stored in the folder `results`
